## Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

When creating a Linux distribution, there are several important
directories commonly used in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
**(**FHS**).** These directories serve specific purposes and help
organize the system files. Here are some of the key directories:

1)  **/bin**: This directory contains essential command**-**line
    executable binaries that are required for booting and basic system
    functionality. It includes common utilities such as ls, cp, and
    rm.

2)  **/boot**: This directory contains files related to the boot
    process, including the kernel, bootloader configuration files, and
    initial ramdisk **(**initramfs**)** images.

3)  **/etc**: This directory contains system**-**wide configuration
    files. It includes various configuration files for services,
    network settings, user authentication, and more.

4)  **/home**: This directory is used to store user home
    directories. Each user typically has a subdirectory within
    **/**home that contains their personal files and settings.

5)  **/lib** and **/lib64**: These directories contain shared libraries
    required by the system and applications. **/**lib is used for
    32**-**bit libraries, while **/**lib64 is used for 64**-**bit
    libraries.

6)  **/opt**: This directory is used for installing additional software
    packages or applications that are not part of the base system.
    It provides a location for self**-**contained software
    installations.

7)  **/sbin**: This directory contains system binaries that are
    primarily used for system administration tasks. These binaries
    often require root privileges to execute.

8)  **/srv**: This directory is used to store data files for services
    provided by the system. Web servers, FTP servers, and other
    network services can use it.

9)  **/tmp**: This directory is used for temporary files that are
    created by applications or during system boot. The contents of
    **/**tmp are typically cleared upon reboot.

10) **/usr**: This directory contains the majority of
    user**-**accessible system files and executables. It includes
    subdirectories like **/**usr**/**bin **(**user binaries**)**,
    **/**usr**/**lib **(**libraries**)**, **/**usr**/**include
    **(**header files**)**, and **/**usr**/**share **(**shared data
    files**).**

11) **/var**: This directory contains variable data files that change
    during system operation. It includes log files, spool
    directories, package databases, and more.
