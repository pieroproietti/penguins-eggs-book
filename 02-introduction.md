# Introduction

The concept behind Penguins's eggs stems from the idea of
**reproduction** and **population selection** applied to
operating systems. 

During the era of popular remastering programs
like Remastersys and Systemback, both of which experienced maintenance
issues and were eventually abandoned, the need for a new, modern tool
became evident. The inspiration for Penguins' Eggs led to the
development of a new tool written in a modern, cross - distribution
language, utilizing its own packaging system. Initially built with
nodejs and later transitioning to Typescript as the primary
development language, the tool's design resembles an egg production
process, consisting of operations such as `produce` for creating
the eggs, and other commands like `kill` for removing produced
ISOs, `update` for software updates, and `install` for
configuring the graphical installer.

The eggs tool is written primarily in TypeScript, Penguins**'** Eggs is
designed to be compatible with various Linux distributions, despite
differences in package managers, file paths, and more**.** The tool
currently supports Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu, Arch, Manjaro, and their
derivatives, across multiple architectures including amd64, i386, and
arm64**.** With the release of version 9**.**6**.**x, Penguins**'** Eggs
is now available as a Debian package, catering to a wide range of
systems including PCs, older machines, and single**-**board ARM systems
like the Raspberry Pi, across amd64, i386, and arm64 architectures**.**
