# penguins-eggs-book

I'm reporting here that my friend [Hossein Seilany
](https://github.com/hosseinseilani) (https://seilany.ir/) wrote about my remastering tool [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs), integrating with mine know how.

It's really hard to write a book, I like to write but always wrote short things, this is my first time.

# Note
I'm editing exclusively with git, using `code` then publing back.

```
git add -A
git commit
git push
```

Then to see the result use button `sync` on [gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com)
