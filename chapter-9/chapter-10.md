# Testing the ISO

To test an ISO created with the `eggs` tool, you can follow
these general steps:

1.  Prepare a Testing Environment: Set up a virtual machine or a
    physical system where you can test the ISO. This can be done
    using virtualization software like VirtualBox or by booting the ISO
    on a separate machine.

Setting up a testing environment for your ISO can be done using a
virtual machine or a physical system. Here\'s how you can do it:

> 2.Virtual Machine Testing:

* Install a virtualization software, prefer KVM based, like `gnome-boxes`, `proxmox-ve`, etc, over proprietary `virtualbox` or `VMware`;

* Create a new virtual machine using the virtualization software.

* During the virtual machine creation process, configure the system
specifications such as CPU, memory, and storage based on your
requirements.

* When prompted to select an ISO or boot media, choose the ISO file
created with the "eggs" tool.

* Complete the virtual machine creation process and start the virtual machine.

* The virtual machine will boot from the ISO, allowing you to test the
operating system or software contained within the ISO.

> 3. Physical System Testing:

-   Prepare a separate computer or device where you can boot the
    ISO.

-   Create a bootable USB drive or burn the ISO to a DVD.

-   Insert the bootable USB or DVD into the target system.

-   Restart the system and access the boot menu or BIOS settings.

-   Choose the bootable USB or DVD as the primary boot device.

-   Save the settings and restart the system.
