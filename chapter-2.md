Creating Live ISO Images in Linux: A Comprehensive Guide

# Live ISO images

In the world of Linux, Live ISO images play a crucial role in providing
users with a versatile and portable means to experience and utilize
different distributions without the need for installation. These
Live ISO images are bootable media that allow users to test, use, and
sometimes install Linux distributions directly from the ISO file without
making any changes to their existing system. In this article, we
will explore the concept of Live ISO images, their significance, and the
process of creating them in Linux.

## Understanding Live ISO Images

A Live ISO image is a snapshot of a bootable operating system that can
be run directly from a CD, DVD, USB drive, or other bootable media
without the need for installation. It enables users to explore and
interact with a Linux distribution without affecting their current
system setup. Live environments are particularly useful for testing
hardware compatibility, trying out different Linux distributions,
troubleshooting system issues, and performing various administrative
tasks. Linux distributions often provide official Live ISO images
for users to download and use. These images typically include a
fully functional desktop environment, a set of pre-installed
applications, and tools for installation and system maintenance.
Additionally, users can create their own customized Live ISO images to
tailor the environment to their specific needs.

## Benefits of Live ISO Images

Live ISO images offer several advantages to both casual users and system
administrators. These benefits include:

1.  Portability: Live ISO images can be carried on a USB drive and used
    on different computers without requiring installation, making them
    highly portable and convenient.

2.  Testing and Evaluation: Users can test and evaluate different Linux
    distributions and their features without committing to a permanent
    installation.

3.  System Recovery: Live environments provide tools for system
    recovery, data backup, and disk partitioning, making them invaluable
    for troubleshooting and maintenance.

4.  Customization: Users can create personalized Live ISO images with
    specific applications, configurations, and settings tailored to
    their requirements.

## Creating Live ISO Images in Linux

Creating a Live ISO image in Linux involves customizing a base Linux
distribution and packaging it into a bootable ISO file. Here's a
step-by-step guide to creating a Live ISO image using popular
open-source tools such as Ubuntu Customization Kit (UCK) and
the command-line tool mkisofs.

1.  Choose a Base Distribution: Select a base Linux distribution such as
    Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian to serve as the foundation for your Live
    ISO image.

2.  Install Custom Software: Customize the base distribution by
    installing additional software packages, tools, and applications to
    meet your specific requirements.

3.  Configure Settings: Adjust system settings, desktop environment
    configurations, and other parameters to reflect your desired
    environment.

4.  Install Optional tools : If using your own distro you can
    customization process through a user**-**friendly interface.

5.  Use Command-line Tools: Alternatively, use command-line
    tools such as `chroot` to create a chroot environment, modify the
    filesystem, and subsequently create the Live ISO image using the
    `mkisofs` tool.

6.  Test the Live ISO Image: Once the customization is complete, test
    the Live ISO image in a virtual machine or by writing it to a USB
    drive for booting on physical hardware.

# Remastering

Remastering a Linux system is like taking a pre-built computer and
customizing it to your liking. You start with an existing Linux
distribution (the operating system), but you can add new software
packages to make it more functional for you. You can also remove
programs that come pre-installed but you don\'t need, making the system
leaner and faster. This process is called remastering, and it gives you
a lot of control over your Linux experience.

# Building process

Building a customized Linux ISO image involves creating a customized
version of a Linux distribution's installation image. This
allows you to pre**-**configure the system with specific software,
settings, and customizations tailored to your needs. To build a
customized Linux ISO image, you typically start with the base ISO image
of the Linux distribution you want to customize. You then modify the
image by adding or removing software packages, setting custom
configurations, adding scripts or additional files, and making any other
necessary adjustments.

Tools like Cubic, Ubuntu Customization Kit, and SUSE Studio are useful
for customizing Ubuntu and SUSE Linux-based distributions,
respectively. These tools provide a graphical interface for
modifying the ISO image without requiring extensive knowledge of the
command line. Once you have made all the desired customizations, you
can build the new ISO image using the appropriate tools provided by the
customization software or by utilizing command**-**line tools like
mkisofs or genisoimage. Building a customized Linux ISO image can be
useful for creating a system with specific software configurations for
deployment across multiple machines or for distributing custom Linux
distributions tailored to particular use cases.

# The ISO image file

The .iso file extension denotes an uncompressed archive disk image
file that mirrors the entire data content of an optical disc, such as a
CD or DVD. Adhering to the ISO-9660 standard, the ISO image file
format embodies the disc data along with its associated filesystem
information, allowing ISO files to house precise replicas of content and
make perfect copies of CDs**/**DVDs for bootable data storage and
installation. These files are usually burned onto USB/CD/DVD
for booting during installation and are identified by the 
`MIME type application/x-iso9660-image`.

The ISO file format is unique, as it encapsulates specified data content
within a binary file accurately representing the content and filesystem
structure. ISO images, regardless of the standard, can be created
from optical discs, a collection of files, or by conversion from another
disk image file, and can be written onto optical discs like CDs, DVDs,
and Blue-Rays. 

They store user data from each optical disc
sector, excluding control headers and error correction data, yielding
slightly smaller file sizes. Aside from ISO 9660 media, an ISO image
may also contain a UDF file system, often utilized by DVDs and
Blu-ray Discs, including the data in binary format as it was stored
on the disc. 

The .iso file extension is the most common for this
type of disc image, while the .img extension is found in some ISO
image files with slightly different contents.

ISO files store only
the user data from each sector on an optical disc, rendering them
substantially smaller than raw optical disc images. ISO images can
be opened with almost every multi-format file archiver and, with the
appropriate driver software, can be `mounted` to interface with
it as if it were a physical optical disc. Most Unix-based
operating systems and versions of Windows have built-in capabilities
for handling ISO images, allowing files to be copied or transferred over
any data link or removable storage medium. The ISO 9660 standard
specifies three levels of interchange, each with specific limits on
filenames, directory names, and the depth and length of the directory
hierarchy and path length of files. The standard ensures the
efficient organization and access of data within the ISO 9660 directory
structure.

### ISO-9660
ISO-9660 is a standard file system for optical disc media, such
as CD-ROMs and DVDs. It was developed by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) and is widely used for
storing data on these types of discs. The ISO-9660 file system
has certain limitations, such as a maximum file size of 4GB and a
maximum directory depth of 8 levels. It also has restrictions on
file and directory naming, limiting them to certain character sets and
lengths. Despite its limitations, ISO-9660 is
widely supported across different operating systems, making it a popular
choice for distributing software and other data on optical discs. It
allows for cross-platform compatibility, as most modern computers
and other devices can read ISO-9660 discs.

## Universal Disk Format (UDF)

UDF is a file system standard for optical disc media, as well as for
other types of storage devices such as flash drives and hard drives.
UDF was developed to address the limitations of ISO-9660 and provide
more flexibility and features for storing and organizing data. UDF
supports larger file sizes, longer file names, and deeper directory
structures compared to ISO-9660. It also includes features such
as support for metadata, file versioning, and resizable volumes. UDF
is designed to be more adaptable to different types of storage media and
is intended to be a more future-proof file system standard.

UDF has gained wide adoption, particularly in the context of DVD and
Blu-ray discs, where it is often used as the primary file
system. It is also supported by most modern operating systems,
making it a versatile choice for data storage and distribution. In
summary, ISO-9660 is an older file system standard primarily used
for optical disc media, while UDF is a more modern and flexible file
system standard that is widely supported across different types of
storage devices. Both standards have their own specific features and
limitations, and the choice between them depends on the specific use
case and compatibility requirements.

# Live system file

The SquashFS (SQUASH File System) is a read-only, compressed
file system widely used in Linux-based operating systems. It is
designed to be a space-efficient file system that can be mounted and
accessed as a normal file system, while also providing compression to
minimize the storage requirements. Here's an in-depth
explanation of SquashFS:

## Introduction to SquashFS

SquashFS was originally developed and is released under the GNU General
Public License. It is known for its high compression ratio and
read-only nature, making it particularly useful for embedding into
operating system images, live CDs, and other scenarios where
read-only access to compressed file systems is required.

## File Compression

One of the key features of SquashFS is its built-in file compression. It
uses various compression algorithms, including zstd. xz, and lzo, to
compress files and directories within the file system. This allows for
significant reduction in the size of the file system image, making it
advantageous for distributions where storage space is a concern.

## Structure of SquashFS

SquashFS consists of multiple components, including the main file system
image, an associated meta-data block, and an optional index
table. The file system image contains the compressed data, while the
meta-data block stores information about files, directories, and
their attributes, facilitating quick file lookup and access. The
index table, if present, improves access performance by providing a
sorted listing of file system components.

## Read-Only Nature

SquashFS is intended to be a read-only file system and does not
support write operations. This is beneficial for scenarios where a
file system needs to be distributed as a read-only image, ensuring
that its contents remain unchanged. While this makes SquashFS
unsuitable for use as a general-purpose read-write file system,
its focus on read-only access aligns with its primary use cases.

## Use Cases

SquashFS is commonly employed in scenarios where efficient,
read-only access to a compressed file system is necessary. Some
prominent use cases include:

-   Live CDs and bootable USB drives: Many Linux distributions use
    SquashFS to store the root file system of live environments,
    allowing users to boot into a fully operational system without
    needing to install it on their hard drive.

-   Embedded systems: SquashFS is often used in embedded devices, such
    as routers, set-top boxes, and other appliances, where
    space-efficient storage and read-only access are
    essential.

-   Software distribution: software vendors to create compressed file
    system images for distributing applications or data in a compact and
    secure manner utilize it.

-   Customized Linux distributions: Many custom Linux distributions and
    derivatives use SquashFS to package the file system, enabling
    efficient distribution and consumption of the distribution's
    contents.

## Handling Compression

SquashFS employs various compression techniques to minimize the storage
footprint of the file system. It leverages the power of established
compression algorithms to efficiently encode files and directories,
reducing the amount of storage space required. This contributes to
faster data transfer and efficient resource utilization. The
selection of multiple compression algorithms, including gzip, lzo, lz4,
xz, and zstd, in the SquashFS**-**tools Makefile showcases the
versatility and adaptability of the SquashFS file system. Each of
these compression algorithms offers distinct features and
trade**-**offs, enabling users to choose the most suitable compression
method based on their specific requirements and constraints.

1)  **gzip:** This is a widely used compression algorithm known for its
    balance between compression ratio and speed. It is
    well-suited for general-purpose compression and
    compatibility but may not provide the highest compression ratios or
    fastest decompression speeds.

2)  **lzo:** LZO is known for its fast compression and decompression
    speeds, making it suitable for scenarios where rapid file access is
    essential. While it may not achieve the highest compression
    ratios, it excels in performance-critical applications.

3)  **lz4:** LZ4 is another fast compression algorithm, known for its
    exceptional compression and decompression speeds, making it ideal
    for use cases that prioritize speed over maximum compression. It
    is commonly used in scenarios where quick access to compressed data
    is paramount.

4)  **xz:** XZ, based on the LZMA compression algorithm, offers
    excellent compression ratios at the cost of slightly slower
    compression and decompression speeds. It is well-suited for
    scenarios where optimal compression is a priority, such as archival
    and distribution purposes.

5)  **zstd:** Zstandard is a relatively newer compression algorithm
    designed to provide both high compression ratios and fast
    compression and decompression speeds. It offers a good balance
    between compression performance and efficiency, making it suitable
    for a wide range of applications.

## Customization and Optimization

SquashFS offers several customization and optimization options, allowing
for tailored deployments based on specific requirements. These
include the ability to configure compression options, optimize file
access patterns through the use of the index table, and control
meta**-**data storage to suit different use cases and workloads.

## Compatibility and Performance

SquashFS is highly compatible with major Linux distributions and is
supported by the Linux kernel. It provides fast native access to
file data, benefiting from optimizations to facilitate efficient read
operations. Through its integration with the Linux kernel, it
delivers robust performance and seamless interoperability with the
broader Linux ecosystem.

    helps protect the boot process from malware and unauthorized
    operating systems. It verifies the digital signature of boot
    loaders, kernel modules, and other firmware components before
    allowing them to execute.

4)  **UEFI Shell:** UEFI includes a built-in shell environment,
    providing a command-line interface that allows for advanced
    system management tasks, such as troubleshooting and diagnosing boot
    issues, managing UEFI settings, and running UEFI applications.

5)  **Network Booting:** UEFI supports network booting, enabling
    computers to boot from network resources using protocols such as PXE
    (Preboot Execution Environment). This is especially useful
    in enterprise environments for deploying and managing large numbers
    of computers.

6)  **Unified Interface:** UEFI provides a standardized interface for
    booting operating systems, regardless of whether they are Windows,
    Linux, or other operating systems. This allows for a consistent
    boot experience across different platforms.

7)  **Improved Hardware Support:** UEFI firmware provides better support
    for modern hardware technologies, such as USB 3.0, NVMe storage
    devices, and advanced graphics cards, ensuring compatibility with
    the latest hardware innovations.

# UEFI Boot Process

The UEFI boot process involves several stages, including
firmware initialization, execution of the UEFI boot manager, loading and
executing the bootloader, and ultimately launching the operating
system. This process is controlled by UEFI firmware, which manages
the boot sequence and invokes the appropriate boot loader based on
system configuration.

# Compatibility with Legacy BIOS

UEFI systems often include a Compatibility Support Module
(CSM) that allows them to boot legacy BIOS**-**based operating
systems and bootloaders. This ensures backward compatibility with
older software that may not be UEFI-aware.

## UEFI Boot Components

1)  **UEFI Firmware:** The UEFI firmware, which resides on the
    motherboard's firmware flash memory, initializes hardware
    components and launches the UEFI boot manager.

2)  **UEFI Boot Manager:** The UEFI boot manager, part of the UEFI
    firmware, is responsible for locating and launching the UEFI
    bootloader for the installed operating system.

3)  **UEFI Bootloader:** The UEFI bootloader, such as GRUB 2 for Linux
    or Windows Boot Manager for Windows, is stored on the EFI system
    partition and is responsible for loading the operating system kernel
    and initializing the OS environment.

4)  **EFI System Partition (ESP):** The EFI System Partition contains
    the UEFI bootloader and related files. It is a specially
    formatted partition on GPT disks where UEFI firmware looks for
    bootloaders of installed operating systems.

# Secure Boot and UEFI

Secure Boot is a UEFI feature that helps prevent the loading of
unauthorized or malicious software during the boot process. It
verifies the digital signatures of bootloaders and their components,
ensuring that only trusted firmware, drivers, and operating systems are
executed.

## UEFI Shell

UEFI provides a built-in shell environment known as the
UEFI Shell. This command**-**line interface allows advanced system
management tasks, such as diagnosing boot issues, updating UEFI
settings, and running UEFI applications for configuration or
troubleshooting purposes.

## UEFI Variables

UEFI defines a standard for storing system configuration
data known as UEFI variables. These variables can be used to store
boot settings, system configuration parameters, and other
firmware-related data that can be accessed and modified by the UEFI
firmware and UEFI applications.

## Vendor-specific UEFI Features

Various hardware vendors and system builders often provide
additional UEFI features and utilities tailored to their specific
platforms. These may include advanced system diagnostics, firmware
update tools, and UEFI configuration interfaces designed to enhance the
user experience and manage system settings.

# Legacy BIOS 

The Basic Input/output System (BIOS),
colloquially referred to as Legacy BIOS, traces its origins back to the
early days of personal computing. Initially introduced by IBM in the
1980s, BIOS served as the fundamental firmware interface for
initializing hardware components, managing system configurations, and
initiating the boot process.

## Operating Principles of Legacy BIOS

1)  **Firmware Initialization:** Legacy BIOS is responsible for
    initializing hardware components such as the CPU, memory, storage
    devices, and peripherals during the system's power**-**on
    sequence.

2)  **Boot Process Management:** It executes the boot sequence by
    loading the operating system's bootloader from the Master Boot
    Record (*MBR) of the storage device, thereby launching the
    operating system.

3)  **System Configuration:** BIOS provides a user-accessible
    interface, allowing users to configure various system settings, such
    as boot order, date and time, and hardware parameters.

## Key Characteristics of Legacy BIOS

1)  **16-bit Real Mode:** Legacy BIOS operates in a 16-bit real
    mode, reflecting its origins in the early era of x86 computing.
    This mode limits access to system memory and imposes certain
    constraints on system operations.

2)  **Partitioning Scheme:** BIOS traditionally relies on the Master
    Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme, which has limitations
    in terms of maximum partition size and the number of partitions,
    hindering support for modern storage devices.

3)  **Lack of Security Features:** Unlike the Secure Boot feature of
    UEFI, Legacy BIOS lacks native security features to validate the
    authenticity of the bootloader and protect against unauthorized code
    execution during the boot process.

4)  **Boot Time and Hardware Support:** while providing a reliable and
    established boot environment, Legacy BIOS tends to have longer boot
    times, limited support for contemporary hardware interfaces, and
    technologies compared to UEFI.

## Legacy and Modern Computing Environments

Despite the evolution towards UEFI as the dominant firmware
interface for modern computer systems, Legacy BIOS continues to maintain
relevance, particularly in legacy hardware environments and for
compatibility with older operating systems and bootloaders. Many
modern systems offer a Compatibility Support Module (CSM) to
enable Legacy BIOS mode for booting legacy software.
