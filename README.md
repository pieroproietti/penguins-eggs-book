# penguins-eggs-book

I'm reporting here that my friend [Hossein Seilany
](https://github.com/hosseinseilani) (https://seilany.ir/) wrote about my remastering tool [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs), integrating with mine know how.

This is not the first book for Hossein Seilany, but it's the first for me and for me it's really hard.
